#Digital #IoT

* IoT can be defined as interconnection of sensing and actuating devices that provide the ability to share information across platforms through a unified framework and with the help of innovative applications can present a common operating picture (Gubbi et al., 2013)
* This is possible with seamless large-scale sensing, data analytics and information representation using cutting edge ubiquitous sensing and cloud computing.
