#Digital #Blockchain

* Ablockchain is a database that stores encrypted blocks of data then chains them together to form a chronological single-source-of-truth for the data
* Digital assets are distributed instead of copied or transferred, creating an immutable record of an asset
* The asset is decentralized, allowing full real-time access and transparency to the public
* A transparent ledger of changes preserves integrity of the document, which creates trust in the asset.
* Blockchainâ€™s inherent security measures and public ledger make it a prime technology for almost every single sector
